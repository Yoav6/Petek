A protocol manging program for conflict resolution (status: on hold).

Note: This project has already been on hold for a few months before uploading the repository

This is project i started partially as an exercise, the idea is to create a system for the conflict resolution committee in the democratic school in hadera which they can use during discussions to record it, to view information about the people present and about past discussions.

It uses pyqt5 for the GUI, and SQLite3 for the database.
